The Spy Device is a portable audio amplifier designed to capture and enhance faint environmental sounds, making it useful for surveillance or as a hearing aid for individuals with partial hearing loss. Built using Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs), the device supports both amplification and attenuation to deliver clear audio without distortion. It integrates a condenser microphone with a wide frequency response, a 3.5mm headphone output jack, and a user-adjustable volume potentiometer. Engineered for safety and efficiency, the device limits output to 300mVrms and 1.3mA, ensuring safe listening through standard earphones. Its simple and efficient analog design makes it a practical and affordable tool for sound enhancement.
